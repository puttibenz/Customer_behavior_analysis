## 📝 Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics study designed to [identify key business questions, e.g., optimize sales strategies and reduce customer churn]. 

By analyzing a dataset of [Number] records, I performed data cleaning and EDA in Python, migrated the data to a SQL database for complex querying, and visualized the actionable insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The final presentation deck was created using Gamma.

**Key Business Problem:** [Briefly state the problem, e.g., How can we increase profitability across underperforming regions?]

## 📂 Dataset
* **Source:** [e.g., Kaggle / Company Internal Data / Public API] - [Link to Dataset]
* **Description:** The dataset contains [Number] rows and [Number] columns, including attributes such as [List 3 major columns, e.g., Order Date, Region, Sales Amount].
* **Time Period:** [e.g., Jan 2020 - Dec 2023]

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Loading, Cleaning, & EDA)
* **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL):** Data storage and complex queries (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions)
* **Power BI:** DAX, Data Modeling, and Dashboard creation
* **Gamma:** AI-powered presentation generation

## 🔄 Project Steps
1.  **Data Loading & Quality Check:** Loaded raw data into Python to identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2.  **Data Cleaning & EDA:** * Handled null values using [Method, e.g., mean imputation].
    * Corrected data types and formatted date columns.
    * Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand distributions.
3.  **Database Management (SQL):** * Designed a schema and inserted cleaned data into [SQL Server/PostgreSQL].
    * Wrote queries to extract KPIs like [Metric 1] and [Metric 2].
4.  **Visualization (Power BI):** * Built a Star Schema data model.
    * Created measures using DAX.
    * Designed an interactive dashboard focusing on [Key Focus Area].
5.  **Reporting:** Compiled findings into a professional presentation using Gamma.

## 📈 Dashboard

*A snapshot of the Power BI Interactive Dashboard.*

## 💡 Key Results & Insights
* **Insight 1:** [e.g., The 'Consumer' segment accounts for 65% of total revenue but has the highest return rate.]
* **Insight 2:** [e.g., Sales peak in Q4, specifically November, driven by holiday promotions.]
* **Insight 3:** [e.g., Shipping delays in the 'West' region are negatively impacting customer satisfaction scores.]

**Recommendation:** [e.g., Focus marketing efforts on the Consumer segment while optimizing logistics in the West region to reduce churn.]
